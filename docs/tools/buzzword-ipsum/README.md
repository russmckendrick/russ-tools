2. **Balances word types** to create grammatically correct structures
3. **Varies sentence length** based on user preferences
4. **Ensures proper capitalization** and punctuation
5. **Generates unique combinations** each time

### Data Structure
```json
{
  "adverbs": ["proactively", "seamlessly", "intelligently", ...],
  "verbs": ["orchestrate", "leverage", "optimize", ...],
  "adjectives": ["AI-powered", "cloud-native", "scalable", ...],
  "nouns": ["microservices", "machine learning", "blockchain", ...]
}
```

## üé≠ Example Output

### Phrases
- "AI-powered microservices architecture"
- "Cloud-native DevOps paradigms"
- "Machine learning optimization strategies"
- "Blockchain-enabled supply chains"

### Sentences
- "Proactively orchestrate AI-powered microservices for enhanced scalability."
- "Seamlessly leverage machine learning algorithms to optimize business processes."
- "Intelligently deploy containerized applications across hybrid cloud environments."

### Paragraphs
