```

#### 2. External Dependencies
- **Certificate parsing**: Native Web Crypto API + custom PEM/DER parser
- **Network requests**: Built-in fetch API for certificate retrieval
- **File handling**: FileReader API for certificate uploads
- **Visualization**: @svgdotjs/svg.js (already available) for chain diagrams
- **Export**: html2canvas (already available) for PDF generation

### API Integration

#### Certificate Retrieval Methods
1. **Direct HTTPS Connection** (primary method)
   - Use fetch API to connect to domain:443
   - Extract certificate chain from TLS handshake
   - Fallback ports: 993, 995, 465, 587

2. **Certificate Transparency Logs** (supplementary)
   - Query CT logs for additional certificate information
   - Use public CT APIs (Google, Cloudflare)

3. **File Upload** (manual analysis)
   - Support PEM, DER, P7B, PFX formats
   - Parse uploaded certificate files
   - Extract chain from PKCS#7/P12 containers

#### Cloudflare Worker Integration
Create new worker endpoint for certificate retrieval:
```javascript
// /certificate-chain/{domain}
// Returns: certificate chain, validation status, CT log data
```

## User Interface Design

### Layout Structure
Following existing tool patterns with tabbed interface:

#### Tab 1: Certificate Input
- Domain input field with validation
- Port selection (default 443)
- File upload area for certificate files
- "Analyze" button with loading state

#### Tab 2: Chain Overview
- Visual chain representation (root → intermediate → leaf)
- Chain validation status with color coding
- Quick summary cards (valid until, issuer, key strength)

#### Tab 3: Certificate Details
- Expandable accordion for each certificate in chain
- Subject/Issuer information
- Validity dates and key usage
- Extensions and policies
- Fingerprints (SHA1, SHA256)

#### Tab 4: Trust & Security Analysis
- Trust path validation results
- Security issues and recommendations
- Certificate transparency status
- OCSP/CRL checking results

#### Tab 5: Export & Reports
- JSON export of full analysis
- CSV export for spreadsheet analysis
- PDF report generation
- Share link functionality

### Visual Design Elements
- **Status indicators**: Green (valid), yellow (warning), red (error)
- **Chain visualization**: Connected nodes showing certificate hierarchy
- **Progress indicators**: Loading states for network operations
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly certificate viewing

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. Create component structure and basic routing
2. Implement certificate parsing utilities
3. Build domain input and basic certificate retrieval
4. Add basic certificate details display

### Phase 2: Chain Analysis (Week 1-2)
1. Implement full chain validation logic

- Temporary certificate storage only during analysis
- Clear sensitive data on component unmount

### Input Validation
- Domain name validation and sanitization
- File type and size restrictions for uploads
- Rate limiting for certificate retrieval requests
- Protection against malicious certificate files

### Error Handling
- Network timeouts and connection failures
- Invalid certificate format handling
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features
- User-friendly error messages

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
