- [x] Restore state on app load
- [x] Add Reset/Clear Design button

### 4. Enhanced Visualization
- [x] Update visualization to show all subnets as proportional segments
- [x] Color blocks, labels, hover details for each subnet
- [x] Show unused space in parent network
- [x] Create a drag and drop reorder tool
- [x] Add resize handles for adjusting subnet sizes
- [x] Visual CIDR slider for subnet resizing

### 5. Network Diagram View
