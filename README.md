# Subnet.Fit

A modern, web-based IPv4 subnet calculator. Built as a static site with NodeJS tooling and ready for Cloudflare Pages.

## Usage

1. Enter an IPv4 address (e.g. `192.168.1.10`).
2. Enter a CIDR prefix (e.g. `/24`) or subnet mask (e.g. `255.255.255.0`).
3. Click "Calculate" to see the results.

## Development

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run locally: `npm run dev` and open the provided URL in your browser.
- Build for production: `npm run build`

## Roadmap
- Graphical subnet visualization (bar chart/block diagram)
- Enhanced input validation and UX
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility improvements
