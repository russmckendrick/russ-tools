# SEO & Metadata Requirements

## Required Fields in toolsConfig.json
Every tool must include comprehensive SEO metadata:

```json
{
  "seoTitle": "Tool Name - Descriptive Title",
  "seoKeywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"],
  "description": "Detailed tool description for meta description",
  "shortDescription": "Brief tool summary",
  "features": ["Feature 1", "Feature 2", "Feature 3"],
  "category": "Tool Category",
  "badges": ["Badge1", "Badge2", "Badge3"]
}
```

## SEO Best Practices
- seoTitle should be unique and descriptive (50-60 characters)
- seoKeywords should include relevant search terms
- description should be compelling and informative (150-160 characters)
- features should highlight key capabilities
- category should match existing categories

## Existing Categories
- Network Tools
- Azure Tools  
- Microsoft Tools
- Developer Tools
- Security Tools

## Schema.org Implementation
