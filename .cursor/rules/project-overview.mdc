# russ-tools Project Overview

This is a React 19 SPA built with Vite providing network and cloud professional tools.

## Core Stack
- React 19 with modern hooks and native metadata support
- Vite for build tooling with optimized chunking
- Mantine UI framework for consistent design
- React Router DOM for client-side routing
- JavaScript/JSX (NOT TypeScript)

## File Conventions
- Component files: `.jsx` extension
- Utility files: `.js` extension
- PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- NO COMMENTS unless explicitly requested

## Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production (includes sitemap generation)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint code linting
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

## Critical Rules
- Use functional components with hooks only
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS edit existing files instead of creating new ones
- NEVER create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Follow existing patterns exactly
